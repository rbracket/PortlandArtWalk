# Mapathons at PDXOSgeo

On May 14 there were fewer than 50 OSM mapped artworks in Portland  <a href="http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/9v3" target="_blank"> OverpassTurbo Query for Portland Artwork tagged nodes...</a>And none had photos.

This summer *pdxosgeo* will map and tag at least 500 artworks in Portland, Vancouver, Gresham, Hillsboro. Along the way benches, eateries, pubs, drinking fountains, historical sites and key tourism attractions will get tagged.   We'll get more points if the work is done by many and if some of these are new OSM contributors.
