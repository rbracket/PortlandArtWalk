# PortlandArtWalk
Mapping 500 outdoor artworks in the Portland-Vancouver Metro Area during the summer of 2015


On May 14 there were fewer than 50 OSM mapped artworks in Portland per this [Overpass Turbo Query] (http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/9v3) And none had photos.

This summer **pdxosgeo** will map and tag at least 500 artworks in Portland, Vancouver, Gresham, Hillsboro. Along the way benches, eateries, pubs, drinking fountains, historical sites and key tourism attractions will get tagged.   


### How? 
- Schedule 4 fieldwork "mapathons", 2 after work, 2 during the day.
- Use Fieldpapers.org for light-weight field work.
- Use Flickr or Mapillary for photos. (Mapillary plugin for JOSM is an accepted Google Summer of Code project, http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2015/AcceptedProjects )
- Test mobile editors http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editing
- Stick to nodes- a good first step in learning OSM. Yes, paper is yucky, but this might work...
- Can't attend?  Opportunistically map the sculptures that you know best. Then, the murals, the poetry posts, the lending libraries.

### For Fieldpapers.org Atlas pages
- A FieldPapers Atlas- assuming a 30 minute walk to collect POI. 
- Lloyd District Atlas  http://fieldpapers.org/atlases/20xojbnq
- Lloyd District Atlas-2 http://fieldpapers.org/atlases/42a5smdt
- June 20th, a Along Park Blocks, starting at Portlandia. http://fieldpapers.org/atlases/3luftup4
- We need to remember to upload, review, and then map our notes.

### Notes and Handouts about tagging and to record more detail than fits on fieldpaper atlas pages.

### A proposed schedule for 2 weeknight and and 2 noon time, outdoor, field trips.

- Monday June 29 - 6PM The Portland Building under Portlandia statue. Gab for 10 minutes, divvy up quadrants- head out. Regroup 8PM.  Test run.  Few participants expected-- I did not publicize.
- Monday July 6 -  6PM The Portland Building under Portlandia statue. Gab for 10 minutes, divvy up quadrants- head out.
- Monday July 13 - Noonish, Meet MAX Expo Center stop (tentative idea- wil tweak to work with Babies and strollers.) Work our way back to PDX.
- Monday July 20 - or a date that works for Matt Sayler, meet after work downtown Vancouver. Gab and Go.
- Monday July 27 - noonish, â€“ 82nd Ave and Division?  Other ideas?
