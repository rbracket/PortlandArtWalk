# PortlandArtWalk
Mapping 500 outdoor scuptures in the Portland-Vancouver Metro Area during the summer of 2015


On May 14 there were fewer than 50 OSM mapped artworks in Portland  <a href="htt
p://overpass-turbo.eu/s/9v3" target="_blank"> OverpassTurbo Query for Portland Artwork tagged nodes...</a>And none had photos.

This summer **pdxosgeo** will map and tag at least 500 artworks in Portland, Van
couver, Gresham, Hillsboro. Along the way benches, eateries, pubs, drinking fountains, historical sites and key tourism attractions will get tagged.   We'll get
 more points if the work is done by many and if some of these are new OSM contri
butors.  


### How? 
- Schedule 4 field work "mapathons", 2 after work, 2 during the day.
- Use Fieldpapers.org for light-weight field work.
- Use Flickr or Mapillary for photos. (Mapillary plugin for JOSM is an accepted Google Summer of Code project, http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2015/AcceptedProjects )
- Test mobile editors http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editing
- Stick to nodes- a good first step in learning OSM. Yes, paper is yucky, but this
 might work...
- Can't attend?  Opportunistically map the sculptures that you know best. Then, th
e murals, the poetry posts, the lending libraries.

### Moving FieldNotes to the Map
After each field trip, each person will be responsible for uploading photos of marked-up fieldpaper.org maps. On the Tuesday evening after each field trip, Katie will be available on a chat and by phone to answer questions or get help. We'l
l check our progress at the beginning of August.


### A proposed schedule for 2 weeknight and and 2 noon time, outdoor, field trips.

- Monday June 29 - 6PM Lloyd District, meet at Holladay Park. Gab for 30 minutes, 
divvy up quadrants- head out.
- Monday July 13 - Noonish, Meet MAX Expo Center stop. Work our way back to PDX.
- Monday July 20 - or a date that works for Matt Sayler, meet after work downtown 
Vancouver. Gab and Go.
- Monday July 27 - noonish, â€“ 82nd Ave and Division?  Other ideas?
